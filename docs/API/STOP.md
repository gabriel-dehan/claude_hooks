# Stop API

Available when inheriting from `ClaudeHooks::Stop`:

## Input Helpers
Input helpers to access the data provided by Claude Code through `STDIN`.

[ðŸ“š Shared input helpers](COMMON.md#input-helpers)

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `stop_hook_active` | Check if Claude Code is already continuing as a result of a stop hook |

## Hook State Methods
Hook state methods are helpers to modify the hook's internal state (`output_data`) before yielding back to Claude Code.

[ðŸ“š Shared hook state methods](COMMON.md#hook-state-methods)

> [!NOTE] 
> In Stop hooks, the decision to "block" actually means to "force Claude to continue", we are "blocking" the blockage. 
> This is counterintuitive and the reason why the method `block!` is aliased to `continue_with_instructions!`

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `continue_with_instructions!(instructions)` | Block Claude from stopping and provide instructions to continue |
| `block!(instructions)` | Alias for `continue_with_instructions!` |
| `ensure_stopping!` | Allow Claude to stop normally (default behavior) |

## Hook Exit Codes

| Exit Code | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `exit 0` | Agent will stop<br/>`STDOUT` shown to user in transcript mode |
| `exit 1` | Non-blocking error<br/>`STDERR` shown to user |
